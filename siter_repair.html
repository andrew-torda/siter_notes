  <h1>Siter goes to the hospital
  </h1>
  <h2>History
  </h2>
<p>The Elphie owns a big (mother-sized) siter. It is big, ornate and
  passers by admire it.
</p>
<p>
  The Elphie owns two baby siters - also known as siter panerus or, in
  google translate, as the successor siter. Neither of these children
  has had an easy life. The older one came with the original
  instruments and had pegs which slipped terribly. This was
  fixable.
</p>
<p>The newer one is prettier, but had other problems and sat on a
  shelf neglected for much of its childhood. This is the repair
  story.
</p>

<h2>Starting point
</h2>
<h3>The twin brother
</h3>
<p>The Elphie's siter has a twin brother. The bass strings broke
during their first tuning. A few others popped and some of the pegs
  slipped badly. This meant we knew what to expect.
</p>

<h3>Strings
</h3>
<p>Guitar strings are rated in thousandths of an inch and come in a
wild variety of metals, with different coatings and with or without
external winding.
</p>
<p>
  Wire for pianos, dulcimers (hackbrett), cembalo is measured in
  sensible units (mm). Unlike guitar strings, the fanciest Steinway
  and oldest honkey-tonk use fairly plain steel.
  </p>
<h3>The starting point
</h3>
<p>
  The first string we played with in the Elphie went
  <em>pop
  </em>, so we knew there would be problems and this was the starting point from the top:

</p>
<p>and on the base, you can see the on the top row how one string is missing from the fourth place and you can also see how things were wired.
  <img src="starting_point_base.JPG" style="width:40%">
  These are guitar strings. A few were crossed over. The lowest strings were what guitarists call 16 thousandths of an inch wound steel:

</p>
<p> If you look really closely, you can see the guitar string ball is sometimes there and sometimes not.

</p>

<h3>First tuning
</h3>
<p>Very gently, I put some tension on the strings. The bass strings
  generally went
  <em>pop
  </em>. The best thing to do is get rid of them.

</p>
<h3>More tuning
</h3>
<p>
  Going a bit further, some of the higher strings went
  <em>ping
  </em>. If one member of a pair popped, I pulled out its partner in the pair. The pelog side now looked like this

  <p>It was time to get out the pliers and some fresh wire.

  <h4>Finished
  </h4>
  <p> The instrument wire came out and many hours later, the pelog side had wire...

  </p>
  <p>More hours later..
    <img src="slendro_finished_top.JPG" alt=""style="width:40%"> and the pelog side,
    <img src="pelog_finished_top.JPG" alt="" style="width:40%">.
  </p>
  <p>The base is OK, but there is a mixture of new and old strings.

  <h5>What string ?
  </h5>
  <p>Wound guitar string was a bad choice. Even when it does not break, it sounds muddy and out of place. 0.37 mm is OK for the lower strings. The instrument had something like 0.27 mm on the higher strings, but this is probably a bit too thick.
  </p>
  <h5>Fixing the string
  </h5>
  <p>
    It turns out, that many of the higher strings were not breaking during tuning. They were simply not fixed on the peg and looked like this.

  <p>The new strings look like this

<div>
  <h2>The current state
  </h2> No work on the pegs was necessary.  There
are four kinds of wire
<ol>
  <li> original horrible guitar wire on the lowest 2
  <li> 3 or 4 pairs of 0.37 mm on the next lowest strings
  <li> 3 to 6 pairs of 0.27 mm on the replaced strings
  <li> guitar wire (about 0.3 mm) on the strings which did not break
    </ol>
      <p>Obviously it would be nicer if there were one or two kinds of
        wire.
      </p>
      <p>I also think 0.27 is a bit thick. There is a lot of tension
      on the higher strings and might be a bit uncomfortable to
        play.
